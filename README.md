# Replicating "Learning to be Efficient"
This repo contains the code for our replication of the paper ["Learning to be Efficient"](https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/132664/1/p293-neil.pdf) done for the first iteration of the course Neuromorphic Computing at Radboud University (taught in 2019/20). The original paper shows how various optimization strategies conducted during training of an ANN can help to reduce the energy consumption or the latency of the spiking version of the the network.

[train.py](train.py) trains models using a total of 4 different optimization strategies with varying hyperparameters.

[convert.py](convert.py) converts to SNN and deploys them to a simulator.

[extract_results.py](extract_results.py) traverses the result files generated by the simulator to extract relevant information.

[analyze_results.py](analyze_results.py) generates tables and figures based on the results.
